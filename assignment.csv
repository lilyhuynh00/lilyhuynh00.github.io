"San Jose, California",This is where I grew up.  I always enjoy coming back home because this is where I made many good friends and wonderful memories.  San Jose has a lot of restaurants that serve food from many different cultures.  My favorite thing to do when I come home is to try new restaurants with my friends and family.,37.320676,-121.949761,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California",https://community-wealth.org/sites/clone.community-wealth.org/files/1024px-San_Jose_CA_Downtown_aerial_view_photo_D_Ramey_Logan.jpg
"Sacramento, California","I have been here on two separate occasions, and I have fond memories of both trips, so this is one of my favorite places.  My first trip here was a 3 day school field trip where I competed for my school's HOSA (Health Occupations Students of America).  I had a great time during this trip because I was able to meet students from all over California.  The second time I came here was for a trip with my best friend.  It was a calming trip where we just tried different restaurants and relaxed at the hotel.  This trip was a wonderful break from school and work obligation.",38.569992,-121.420289,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California",https://a.cdn-hotels.com/gdcs/production152/d1609/fb5c78a2-aef9-4606-808e-86c39d311e94.jpg
Disneyland,This is also a place that I have fond memories of because I have traveled here with my friends and family to go to Disneyland.

"Honolulu, Hawaii","I have left California two times in my entire life, and this place is where I went to for one of those visits.  My sister had a volleyball tournament in Hawaii, so my mother and I took this opportunity to come to Hawaii as well.  I really enjoyed going to the beaches and wandering the marketplaces in Hawaii.

Vietnam,"This is the country that my family is from.  My parents moved to the US before I was born and worked hard to create a home that they can raise me and my sister in.  I have traveled here once with my family, but I was only six years old so I do not remember much from this trip.  I hope to travel here in the future.",13.396092,108.340274,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam,https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/61670b60d4f9beb94308c030/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Vietnam_GettyImages-1189270938.jpg

"San Francisco, California","This is a place that I often go to for day trips with my friends and family.
